Hello, Dr.Donyina

My name is Han Wang, And I'm a transfer student from Olympic College
at Bremerton, WA. My major is CSS.
I like to do some teamwork with others,
and I'm really enjoy to share something with other people.
This is a binary calculater that what I did from my previous java
class. It is not a difficult project, but it takes me a lot of time
to proof the calculation. Thank you to take your time on my little
project.
